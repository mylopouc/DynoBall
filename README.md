# DynoBall

A game for real life ball movement.

This application will consist:

* Solver in c++
* Python interface (Pygame ??)
* Connection between them (Python with c++)


Working environment:

* Git/GitHub
* Visual Studio (C++)
* PyCharm (Python)
  

## Solver
* C++ language
* Analytical dynamics
* Find correct integration scheme
* Correct numerical analysis method
* Optimize for speed
* Write down results to a file
  
## Interface

* Pygame (?)
* OpenGL in c++ (?)

## Connection

* calling DLL from Python (?)
